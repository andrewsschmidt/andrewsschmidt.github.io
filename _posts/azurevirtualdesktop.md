# What is Azure Virtual Desktop?

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud.

Here's what you can do when you run Azure Virtual Desktop on Azure:

- Set up a multi-session Windows 11 or Windows 10 deployment that delivers a full Windows experience with scalability
- Present Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and optimize it to run in multi-user virtual scenarios
- Bring your existing Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and Windows Server desktops and apps to any computer
- Virtualize both desktops and apps
- Manage desktops and apps from different Windows and Windows Server operating systems with a unified management experience

```PowerShell
